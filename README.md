QWAZERTY
========

A keyboard layout for French AZERTY keyboards (or any [ISO
keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_9995)).

Based on the U.S. QWERTY layout, it reproduces all keys in QWERTY. Notably, the
"grave accent"/"tilde" key is restored to its normal position at the top left of
the keyboard (Apple's U.S. layout for ISO keyboards moves this next to the left
"Shift" key).

Additionally, the key next to the left "Shift" key, which doesn't exist on ANSI
keyboards, is changed to input a set of emoji glyphs. It provides four emojis in
total (one for each of the following modifiers: normal, Shift, Option,
Option-Shift). These emojis can be used for faster shortcuts. The single-key
normal mode emoji can, for example, be bound to a frequent action, enabling
access to functionality with a single button press.
